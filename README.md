# Dev Instructions

For development, we need a testnet and node with http api endpoint enabled. You can run your own and edit the `start-react` script inside `package.json`, but for these instructions we will assume there is a node/http endpoint available at `138.197.194.220:8877` and connect to it. The chain Id used is `1c6ae7719a2a3b4ecb19584a30ff510ba1b6ded86e1fd8b8fc22f1179c622a32`.

On the project root:

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`

# Production instructions

For production use, run the `build` with either `npm build` or `yarn build` and start the server by running `node server.js`. You may use a package manager such as `pm2`.
